## MyPlace

**Find apartments to get intimate with.**

###Team members:
Josh, Jessica, Christian, Gregg, Paul

###Problem:
People need a place to live and not everyone can afford a house, one of the biggest challenges when finding a new place is knowing your future neighborhood before you make the commitment.

###Solution:
MyPlace solves this by displaying available apartments for rent based off of your search city, it then cultivates a list of places you can scroll through, when you like an apartment you can favorite it with the heart to view it later. Clicking on a search result will enlarge the search giving you further details about what's in the neighborhood! Itâ€™s that simple.

###Sketch of final project:

###APIs: Walk Score, Google Maps, Realtor, Geolocation

### Breakdown of Tasks:

**Josh:** Apartment Search API and data management involved
**Jessica:** Front End UI Design and JS rendering of results
**Christian:** Tying in the search results with the maps (Search Feature)
**Gregg:** Walk Score API for (Grocery store, School, Transportation, ect) - Needs to give us plot points (coordinates) to plot on our map
**Paul:** Google Maps (Background image on front end) & Favorites (Local storage of favorited search results - if you are logged in will save to firebase)

###Minimum Viable Product (MVP):
Apartment aggregator with the ability to favorite (adds to a list to review later)
Shows the grocery stores/schools, etc in the area
